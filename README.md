# SeleniumGridExample
Here I am using RemoteDriver to run a selenium grid test.  WebDriverÂ will start up a web browser on the computer where the code instantiates it. For example. If you write a bit of code, and then run it to see how you are doing, the browser will pop up on your screen and you will see WebDriver begin to manipulate that web browser window (if everything went well!)
